# Ten

### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **System Requirements**:
   - **CPU**: At least 4vCPUs, 8vCPUs recommended.
   - **RAM**: Minimum of 8 GB.
   - **Disk**: 200-300 GB SSD (NVMe recommended).
   - **Network**: 400 Mbit/s bandwidth recommended.

2. **Install Prerequisites**:
   - Update your server and install dependencies such as Git, Go, and any other required packages.
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install build-essential git curl jq -y
   ```
   - Install Go from the official site, ensuring you follow the specific version required by Ten.

3. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Clone the Ten blockchain repository and build the binary.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TenLabs/ten-chain.git
   cd ten-chain
   make install
   ```

4. **Initialize the Node**:
   - Initialize the node with a custom moniker.
   ```bash
   tendermint init --chain-id ten-chain
   ```

5. **Configure the Node**:
   - Open the configuration file and adjust the settings like `seeds` and `persistent_peers` to connect with the Ten blockchain network. This information is typically available in the official Ten blockchain docs or community forums.

6. **Start the Node**:
   - Start the full node to sync with the blockchain.
   ```bash
   tendermint start
   ```

7. **Create a Validator**:
   - Once your node is synced, you can create a validator by staking a minimum amount of tokens.
   ```bash
   tendermint tx staking create-validator \
   --amount=10000000utoken \
   --pubkey=$(tendermint tendermint show-validator) \
   --moniker="YourValidatorName" \
   --chain-id=ten-chain
   ```

8. **Monitor and Secure**:
   - Regularly monitor your node's performance. Make sure itâ€™s always online to avoid slashing. You should also back up your keys and maintain security by using firewalls and other security measures.
